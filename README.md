# Forget Crossfade
An autoswitching crossfade plugin for MediaMonkey that adapts the crossfade settings to suit the relationship one song should have to the next.

Hello,
I've put together a functional little script to help listening to seamless music require less action.

Since MM3 implemented crossfading it's great, when you’re listening to a selection of random songs, it enables a seamless transition between them. When your listening to an album in it’s normal order, however, the tracks have generally been produced in a seamless way already and crossfading them can ruin that.

Forget about changing the crossfade settings, they will take care of themselves from now on!

Forget Crossfade will mean you no longer need to turn on and off the crossfade settings when you play different songs in succession. 15 seconds before any track you are playing finishes, Forget Crossfade will check what track is coming up next. If the track is the next song on the same album, it will turn crossfading off automatically. If the track is not the next track on the album (or shuffle is turned on) then crossfading will be turned on (with the same timing settings you already had set).

To activate or deactivate Forget Crossfade, click “Auto Crossfade” in the Play Menu.

This script should be very useful for most people without them even having to think about it.. especially anyone who listens to mix cd's!
